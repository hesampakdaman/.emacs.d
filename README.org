* GNU Emacs
[[file:emacs/emacs.png]]

This configuration requires =Emacs 29.1+= to run. In order to get
started after installing Emacs run the command

#+begin_src bash
  $ emacs --batch -l org ~/dotfiles/emacs/init.org -f org-babel-tangle
#+end_src

It will generate an =init.el= file inside Emacs default configuration
directory, =~/.emacs.d/= in Linux. Now open up Emacs to download and
compile all declared packages. That's it!

* GNU Stow
Install GNU Stow and link packages, e.g. =stow bash=. Alternatively, run
=./stowit.sh= to link all packages in this folder (except bin and misc).
