* GNU Emacs
To setup Emacs after installing it we run the following command

```shell
$ emacs --batch -l org ~/dotfiles/emacs/init.org -f org-babel-tangle
```

which generates an =init.el= file inside Emacs configuration
directory, ususally =~/.emacs.d/=. Then open Emacs as usual and all
declared packages will be downloaded. That's it!

* vim
Install vim-plug =curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim; vim +PlugInstall=.
* GNU Stow
Install GNU Stow and link packages, e.g. =stow bash=. Alternatively, run
=./stowit.sh= to link all packages in this folder (except bin and misc).
