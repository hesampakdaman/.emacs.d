* GNU Emacs
[[file:emacs.png]]

This configuration requires =Emacs 29.1+= to run. After installing
Emacs run the command

#+begin_src bash
  $ emacs --batch -l org ./emacs/init.org -f org-babel-tangle
#+end_src

which generates an =init.el= file inside Emacs default configuration
directory. Now open up Emacs and it will automatically download,
install and compile all declared packages the first time. That's it!

* GNU Stow
Install GNU Stow and link packages, e.g. =stow bash=. Alternatively, run
=./stowit.sh= to link all packages in this folder (except bin and misc).
