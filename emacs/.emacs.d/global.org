* Introduction
In this file we define global variables to be consumed in other
files. For example, the `leader-meta-spc` is global leader key used in
many places and theming variables for colors too.

* The package `general`
Simplifies setting keybindings and has advanced features for
prefix/leader keys.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package general
    :init
    (general-auto-unbind-keys))
#+END_SRC

* Leaders Keys
Here we define leaders to be used throughout emacs. We have other
leader-keys that could be defined elsewhere because they are related
to a specifc file. For example as `leader-agenda-gtd` could be placed
in `org-mode.org`. But we prefer to put them here to have all leaders
in one place.


#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Prefix to be used for all kinds of stuff
  (general-create-definer leader-meta-spc
    :prefix "M-SPC")

  ;; Sub-leader for agenda & GTD
  (general-create-definer leader-org-mode
    :prefix "C-c o")

  ;; Sub-leader for redshift
  (general-create-definer leader-super-r
    :prefix "M-SPC r")

  ;; Leader for editing text
  (general-create-definer leader-editing
    :prefix "C-c e")

  ;; Leader for window management
  (general-create-definer leader-window
    :prefix "C-c w")

* Dracula Theme
Use the Dracula theme for Emacs and define the palette here so we can
use its values in our configuration elsewhere.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package dracula-theme)
  (defvar dracula-bg      "#282a36")
  (defvar dracula-fg      "#f8f8f2")
  (defvar dracula-current "#44475a")
  (defvar dracula-comment "#6272a4")
  (defvar dracula-cyan    "#8be9fd")
  (defvar dracula-green   "#50fa7b")
  (defvar dracula-orange  "#ffb86c")
  (defvar dracula-pink    "#ff79c6")
  (defvar dracula-purple  "#bd93f9")
  (defvar dracula-red     "#ff5555")
  (defvar dracula-yellow  "#f1fa8c")
  (defvar dracula-white   "#f8f8f2")
